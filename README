This is an application to observe a sjoelbak (dutch shuffleboard) with an option to also automating the shooting of the disc.
The project consists of the C# application built in Visual studio 2022 and a small application for an arduino.

The arduino/disc shooter will be within the DiscShooter folder.
The Other part can be directly opened in VS and can be edited as soon as you open it.

The Depthsensor used for this project is the Realsense L515 from Intel.
To be able to run the application with said sensor, you not only need to have the sensor but also the neccesary driver. This can be downloaded here: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.42.0 

The communication with the arduino is done through Serial.

If in any case you want to add another launcher or sensor, this is possible. Each of them has an interface which as long as you follow these they should work.
